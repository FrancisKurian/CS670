0 Natural Language Processing
There are currently two different approaches to NLP.  The first one is the analysis of words, sentences, and 
the  semantics  of  text.    There  are  various  software  packages  that  can  provide  these  capabilities.  These 
software packages are Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK), TextBlob, and spaCy.   
 
The  other  approach  to  NLP  is  using  the  Machine/Deep  Learning  strategy  to  analyze  the  text.    Neural 
Network models are used to train a model by feeding it a lot of text data.  Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 
provides  a  Machine  Learning  (ML)  API  (Application  Programming  Interface)  for  the  analysis  of  Natural 
Languages and provides translation service between languages.  
 
This course explores both approaches to NLP.
